### Hi there 👋

I'm Sebastian, a student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, diving headfirst into the world of Computer Systems Engineering! I'm passionate about the intersection of tech and leadership, always looking for new ways to innovate and make a difference.

But it's not all circuits and code! When I'm not neck-deep in studies, you can find me:

*   🎮 Playing Video Games
*   🎹 Tickling the ivories on my piano.
*   ⛷️ Shredding the slopes (or attempting to) while skiing.
*   🏍️ Getting my adrenaline fix with powersports on my quad and motorcycle.
